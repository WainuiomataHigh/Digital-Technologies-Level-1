**Statement on authenticity and AI**

1.  By submitting this work for marking you are adhering to Wainuiomata
    High School's (and NZQAs) policy on authenticity

2.  Generative Artificial Intelligence (commonly referred to as AI)
    cannot be used in the [production of your outcome]{.underline}. For
    example: coding autofill, tools that generate or rephrase your
    documentation, and auto-designers. AI can be used to generate small
    examples of tools and techniques in practice for learning purposes,
    but need to be treated, referenced and acknowledged in the same way
    as traditional resources. Direct use of AI material will be treated
    as plagiarism.
