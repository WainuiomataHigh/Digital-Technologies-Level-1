## $${\color{red} IMPORTANT!}$$

**Learn** and **apply** the vocabulary and terms to describe and justify the usability choices being examined.  Many students have provided
excellent descriptions of some of the heuristics and rules but have FAILED the exam through not applying correct terms and vocabulary.
