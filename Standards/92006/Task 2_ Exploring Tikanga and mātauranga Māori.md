# Exploring Tikanga and mātauranga Māori

This worksheet asks questions about the CS Field Guide section on [Usability principles relating to mātāpono Māori](https://www.csfieldguide.org.nz/en/chapters/human-computer-interaction/m%C4%81t%C4%81pono-m%C4%81ori/#tikanga-and-matauranga-maori), and the article by Te Taka Keegan, (2017). [Māori language interfaces](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c2Twe_AKuXrbR1bQQICWSHolByiL3Qu6/view).

As you work through this worksheet, highlight the correct answer or write a sentence or two of your own to the short answer sections.

It may also be useful to use a text to speech tool such as [Read Aloud](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/read-aloud-a-text-to-spee/hdhinadidafjejdhmfkjgnolgimiaplp?hl=en), this is especially true of neurodiverse students. Please note that this software has some issues pronouncing Māori words which itself could be failing in some aspects of Mātauranga Māori.

# Step 2.1: Defining important terms

First check out the first section of the [CS Field Guide](https://www.csfieldguide.org.nz/en/chapters/human-computer-interaction/m%C4%81t%C4%81pono-m%C4%81ori/#tikanga-and-matauranga-maori) defines a few terms that are important for understanding the Māori terms related to the mātauranga Māori. Read the CS Field Guides definitions and then try to reword them in your own way. It may be useful to google other definitions of these terms to broaden your understanding.

| Māori term | CS Field Guide Definition | My Definition |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Manaakitanga** | Which is based on the word “mana” \- upholding a person’s mana, or showing respect for them. |  |
| **Rangatiratanga** | The right to exercise authority and self determination. |  |
| **Whanaungatanga** | Building relationships with people, which usually starts with finding common connections through places and people. |  |
| **Kaitiakitanga** | Which is guardianship and protection of the resources entrusted to you. |  |

After you have compiled your own definitions you may want to share these as a class and practise some manaakitanga to broaden your own and others understanding.
